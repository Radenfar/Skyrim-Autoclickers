In this folder are three useful skyrim auto-levellers and helpers for you.
All three require pyautogui.

Dependencies:
pyautogui -> 'python -m pip install pyautogui'

Enter the above command into your command line and pick which ever auto-leveller you need!
Each one does something slightly different.

Restoration Leveller:
-----------------------
The restoration leveller is used on the equilibrium/healing loop.
Perks into increasing the amount of restoration gained from heal is recommended.

Cast Levelling:
-----------------------
This can be used for any spell and will simply cast a spell over and over again to level your character up.
Note that this does not work on spells that require damage or a specific target to give xp such as any destruction spell.
